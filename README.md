# Recommendations-with-IBM
 
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to design a recommendation strategy for users in the IBM Watson studio. A variety of techniques will be explored including 
- rank based recommendation
- user based collaborative filtering
- matrix factorization

## Motivation
When recommending articles for users, the most naive way to do it would be to just show them the most popular articles. However, a better way would be to use whatever information we have about the suers and the articles to show users more relevant recommendations and improve click rate and read rate of the articles. This project explores different ways to do that.
